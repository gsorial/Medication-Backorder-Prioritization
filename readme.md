Xor Linked List

A Xor linked list takes advantage of the properties of the 'exclusive or function' to store both next and previous node data in a single pointer. It allows for memory efficient lists.

This structure will store patients (Nodes) in chronilogical order of with patients at the top of the list being the ones next due for infusions. 

To compile the code go to the build folder and type 'make' in the terminal and then run main_1.cpp.
